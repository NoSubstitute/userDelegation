## WORK IN PROGRESS! Code works, but secrets.gs is lacking secrets.

# userDelegation
Pull info from the Sheet, and Add, Delete or List delegates

[Copy template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/NotTheCorrectTemplateFile/copy) to get Sheet with Google Apps Script.
You can't copy template yet, as the template files doesn't have the most recent code yet. It will, soon.

## How to make it work
secrets.gs needs secrets from a service account with domain wide access to the necessary scopes.

I am going to document how that is done in the wiki.

The secrets.gs in the repo will never have any secrets, as that would give any user acess to my domain. Which is why you also shouldn't post your secrets publically, and only give access to this sheet and script to trusted admins. Even if that's a given, it never hurts to remind people. :-)
